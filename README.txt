This prototype for Volcan's new intranet was created in HTML5 and utilizes the Bootstrap CSS framework. Bootstrap was chosen to simplify the process of placing elements on the page, rather than for stylistic or design reasons. 
 
To test this prototype, please begin by clicking on index.html, and proceed to click the "Log In" button. This will sign you into the site as "Colin Furness", a volunteer with Volcan. From here you can browse mandates, different people within and related to the organization, upload files or volunteer hours. The collateral content contains related content based on your role, and your relationship with others or their mandates. To navigate, please use either the global navigation, or the breadcrumbs. Sorting and filters are used on some pages to help the user find people and posts more efficiently.

Note that other users will have privileges available to them based on their role - project directors would be able to enter descriptions for mandates, pin posts on their mandate pages, and approve uploaded files. Meanwhile volunteer coordinators would be able to see the volunteers directly under their supervision, and receive volunteer uploads.  

Finally, we attempted to address the informational needs of the different groups in this prototype, however you will be browsing as a Volunteer. Regardless we feel that content creation and information seeking behaviour common across all user groups is well represented via the prototype. For example, by linking all data to either a person or a mandate we make it easier for the Project Director to find the relevant information to project reports. Uploads allow volunteers and external groups (NGOs, government) to share information with project directors and volunteer coordinators in a single place.

Note: Underlined text are supposed to represent hyperlinks, however these are non-functional.
